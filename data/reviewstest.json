This place is cheap, quick, and easy to get to.  I always ended up eating here when I visit Berkeley friends or go thrift shopping. My friends and I usually order 4 dishes and split the remainder as we usually cannot make up our minds on what we want to eat. Definitely a hole in the wall kinda ambiance, but that does not mean they are lacking in flavor. The pineapple fried rice, thai fried rice, pad kea mow, pad thai, pad see ew, tom yum soup are all great, but the best dish here has to be the fried red sauce fish (not sure what the correct name is, will update this review) the sauce is tender, sweet, and spicy. I have dreams about this sauce!", "stars": 4, "user_id": "90wm_01FAIqhcgV_mPON9Q", "date": "2012-02-27"}
